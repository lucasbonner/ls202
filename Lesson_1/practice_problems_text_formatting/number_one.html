    <h1>Practice Problem 1</h1>
    <p>
      I realize I could just as easily copy and paste something here, however, why not write something?
      Right now I'm listening to Power Trip while working through these HTML practice problems in order to
      test my skills. I'm really enjoying this course as part of the Launch School curriculum.
      Overall, I hope one day I can adequetely code both backend and frontend in order to be a "Full Stack"
      developer. I think this paragraph is just about long enough. Thanks for reading.
